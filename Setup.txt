OpenGL + GLU + GLUI + GLUT Libraries:
-------------------------------------
DLLs - Place them all in your Windows system folder
	eg. if you have Win9x/Me, put them in C:\Windows\System\
	eg. if you have winnt/2k/xp, put them in C:\windows\system32\

LIBs - Place them in your Visual Studio lib folder
	eg. VisualStudio6 users ->
		C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\lib

Includes - Place them in your Visual Studio Include folder
	eg. VisualStudio6 users ->
		C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include\
		C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include\GL
		(i like to keep two copies)

For people who use Borland C++, you'll use the glut.def file somewhere


GLUI Setup: (alternative GUI from SG)
-----------
GLUI will have to be linked in order for it to work.
Go to Project --> Settings -> Link

Scroll to the end of the "Object/library models:" text box
and add the following additional libraries:   

	glu32.lib glut32.lib opengl32.lib glaux32.lib 


Extra stuff:
-----------

If you want to get rid of the console window
(the black text window that appears when you run your program):
	1. Use menu to go to Project... Settings... Link... Project Options
	2. In the Project Options field find:
	
		/subsystem:console (it's one of the last lines)

	change it to

		/subsystem:windows /entry:mainCRTStartup

Note that error messages and output will be lost (unless redirected)
if you get rid of the console window.
