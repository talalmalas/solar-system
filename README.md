Solar System 1.0 is an OpenGL application that implements a pseudo-solar system by applying transformations (translations and rotations) on object matrices. GLUI is used to provide a friendlier user interface and some effects such as lighting are used. The interface is pretty self explanatory and for fine-tuning, you can use the keyboard to manipulate views and the mouse drag function for custom translations.
